# Image Gallery
------

## Requirements
  - Node version 4+
    Can be downloaded [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)

  - NPM
    Is packaged with Node so you should be fine on that

## Serving the Gallery Locally
  - First cd into the repo and run:
    `npm install`
  
  - Then run:
    `npm start`

  - From there a browser tab should automatically open with the loaded page. If not, simply navigate to `http://http://localhost:9999/` and you should see the gallery.

## Deployed Version
  - You can see a deployed version [here](https://db-image-gallery.herokuapp.com/)!
