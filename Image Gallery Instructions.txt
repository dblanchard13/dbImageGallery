Create a webpage that displays a gallery of images, given a JSON array containing a list of image URLs.

Here are the requirements:

• Do not use any Javascript libraries or frameworks for your webpage. Javascript build tools are ok.

• ES5 or above is preferred.

• The basic layout should be a grid of pictures.

• The images should be reorder-able by dragging and dropping.

• Any other functionality is not expected.

• The submitted code should be runnable and viewable. Add any instructions necessary to a README.md.

You are provided with a directory of sample pictures for convenience.
